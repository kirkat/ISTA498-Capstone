Amy Nicholson,9/27/2019,This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.,POS
Oliver Jones,5/1/2019,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.",POS
Matthew Norman,4/28/2019,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.,POS
Richard Brody,4/28/2019,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder.",NEG
Matthew Lickona,4/27/2019,"The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment.",POS
Dana Stevens,4/26/2019,Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone's favorite parts of these movies anyway.,POS
Kevin Maher,4/26/2019,"It's overdone and bombastic. A fitting end, in other words, to a franchise cycle of insatiable commercial ambition...and thundering creative swagger.",POS
Matthew Rozsa,4/26/2019,"There are horror movies and political dramas with premises less nightmarish than the one in ""Avengers: Endgame... This is an interesting approach for a superhero film to take.",POS
Anthony Lane,4/26/2019,"You can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.",NEG
Bob Mondello,4/26/2019,"No matter how much homework you've done, what actually happens, the order in which it happens and the folks to whom it happens will still pack surprises - also tongue-in-cheekiness and quite a bit of lump-in-throatiness.",POS
Leah Pickett,4/25/2019,"A film that should feel overlong and overstuffed rings purposeful, weighted with existential truth even as it flashes before our eyes.",POS
Peter Rainer,4/25/2019,"Despite all the whiz-bang CGI effects, some more special than others, the moments I most appreciated in Endgame were the small-scale comic touches... Best of all is Robert Downey Jr.",POS
Chris Hewitt,4/25/2019,"It's an episodic movie, so it shines in parts, rather than as a whole, but there are plenty of good parts.",POS
Peter Travers,4/25/2019,The MCU's long goodbye to the Avengers (is it really?) comes off as truly epic and thunderously exciting. But here's the big surprise-it's also an emotional wipeout .,POS
James Berardinelli,4/25/2019,"Avengers: Endgame isn't as brash, surprising, or relentless as its predecessor but it's a worthy conclusion to the Infinity War duology and provides a satisfying end to the First Avengers Era.",POS
Jake Wilson,4/25/2019,"For young adults who have literally grown up with these movies, the experience may be emotionally overwhelming.",POS
Richard Roeper,4/24/2019,The Motion Picture Academy never recognizes great acting if it comes attached to a costume or a cape. That doesn't mean Downey isn't deserving of an Oscar. It's great acting in a great film.,POS
Nicholas Barber,4/24/2019,[I]t is slick and affectionate enough for its three-hour running time to pass quickly.,POS
John Wenzel,4/24/2019,"The MCU sticks this landing, allowing us to let go of years of baggage and get ready for the next flight.",POS
Stephanie Zacharek,4/24/2019,"It's an entertainment designed to please many, many people and disappoint as few as possible, extravagant without necessarily having a vision beyond its desire not to put a foot wrong.",POS
Katie Walsh,4/24/2019,"Perhaps the Russos have made the final installment of the series this lackluster to make it easier to say goodbye to the superheroes, in this iteration. We really don't need another one. Not like this.",NEG
Geoffrey Macnab,4/24/2019,"This is a movie that dazzles you with its spectacle, provides plenty of irreverent slapstick and gags along the way and yet still ends with a huge emotional kick.",POS
Mark Feeney,4/24/2019,"The movie is ludicrously long, clocking in at three hours and one minute, but surprisingly satisfying.",POS
Joe Morgenstern,4/24/2019,"Succeeds at its daunting task: summing up an epic struggle with bedazzling action... and with more humor, zest and feeling -- the real, heartfelt stuff -- than you'd dare to expect from what is, after all, an immense industrial undertaking.",POS
Brandon Katz,4/24/2019,Endgame is a movie that is nothing you'd expect but everything you want.,POS
A.A. Dowd,4/24/2019,"An earnest, overstuffed, fitfully funny superhero melodrama, Endgame hits the buttons it wants to hit, and sometimes affectingly.",POS
Adam Graham,4/24/2019,"""Endgame"" contemplates big-picture themes within a superhero framework and delivers a hugely entertaining ride worthy of its monumental buildup.",POS
Michael O'Sullivan,4/24/2019,"In a sense, ""Endgame"" is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation.",POS
Kerry Lengel,4/24/2019,"The franchise has its ups and downs; the first ""Avengers"" film is certainly a highlight. But the sequels have the wisecracking-superteam formula on lockdown. They always deliver everything fans could hope for - except maybe any genuine surprise.",POS
Joshua Rothkopf,4/24/2019,"Endgame often pays tribute to itself, which makes it as fascinating as it is self-serious. It taps into a live wire of doomy tragedy and phoenix-like rebirth that comics do so well.",POS
Brian Tallerico,4/24/2019,"In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.",POS
Hannah Woodhead,4/24/2019,A potent reminder of all that's good and bad about movies.,POS
Rafer Guzman,4/24/2019,"What ""The Deathly Hallows"" was to ""Harry Potter,"" what ""Return of the Jedi"" was to the original ""Star Wars,"" this gargantuan ""Endgame"" will be to the ""Avengers.""",POS
Danny Leigh,4/24/2019,"The japey inter-hero rivalries and beyond-state-of-the-art visuals go down as easily as always in a formula which, if never quite revolutionising the comic book saga, gave it a much-needed overhaul...",POS
Peter Howell,4/24/2019,Mathematicians say infinity has no end. Avengers: Endgame thrillingly and movingly proves them wrong.,POS
Moira MacDonald,4/24/2019,"Oh yes indeed. ""Avengers: Endgame"" brought it.",POS
David Edelstein,4/24/2019,"Even at three-plus hours, the gargantuan Avengers: Endgame is light on its feet and more freely inventive than it needed to be.",POS
Cary Darling,4/24/2019,"""Endgame"" is the most emotional of the Avengers movies, a tear-stained farewell that effectively tugs at the heartstrings while simultaneously blowing them up with a large army's worth of CGI warfare.",POS
Mick LaSalle,4/24/2019,"It's a quality action movie that accomplishes, with seeming ease, a number of difficult things.",POS
Mara Reinstein,4/23/2019,Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have somehow crafted a coherent and exhilarating epic that incorporates all your favorite superheroes (and many of their loved ones) in one emotionally resonant package.,POS
Robbie Collin,4/23/2019,I can't recall a film in this cinematic universe or any other that works as relentlessly and ingeniously to keep delighting its audience than this.,POS
Mark Daniell,4/23/2019,We haven't seen anything like this before in franchise movie-making. One can only hope that the next 10 years of Marvel storytelling comes close to this.,POS
Eric Kohn,4/23/2019,"As ""Endgame"" sputters to the finish line, it leaves the impression of witnessing a Marvel Movie Marathon compressed to three hours - and 58 seconds, but trust me, they're disposable - of unbridled fan service.",POS
Jake Coyle,4/23/2019,"More than any of those franchises, ""Endgame,"" at its best moments, carries the thrill of classic comic-book twists and reversals.",POS
Barry Hertz,4/23/2019,[T]he entire endeavour loses any sense of emotional stakes or general meaning beyond the deliverance of crass fan-service and incomprehensible visuals.,NEG
Brian Truitt,4/23/2019,"If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band's individual albums, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside.",POS
Johnny Oleksinski,4/23/2019,You have to hand it to the directors for their ambition in bringing together a clown car full of characters into such a well-told and compelling yarn.,POS
Michael Phillips,4/23/2019,[E]xtravagant - and mostly very gratifying.,POS
David Sims,4/23/2019,"The Avengers, as a concept, probably won't be going anywhere, but Endgame still feels like a proper goodbye.",POS
Brian Lowry,4/23/2019,"Having set up a formidable task and then some with the finish of ""Infinity War,"" ""Avengers: Endgame"" rises to the challenge, delivering an epic finale that proves immensely satisfying.",POS
A.O. Scott,4/23/2019,"At its best - and ""Endgame"" is in some ways as good as it gets - the ""Avengers"" cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place.",POS
Leah Greenblatt,4/23/2019,"The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges.",POS
Todd McCarthy,4/23/2019,"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man.",POS
Peter Bradshaw,4/23/2019,"I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.",POS
Peter Debruge,4/23/2019,"After the must-see showdown that was 'Infinity War,' the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour followup, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.",POS
Alonso Duralde,4/23/2019,"Has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the MCU, it has the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream direct from the spray can.",POS
Justin Chang,4/23/2019,"To these faintly moistened eyes, ""Avengers: Endgame"" achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis.",POS
