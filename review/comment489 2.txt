Although, I personally enjoyed #Endgame more. Not just because of the final act but because the ending of Infinity War wasn't set in stone (pun intended). We all knew that the dusted heroes were going to come back one way or another, so their "deaths" didn't have an impact on me. pic.twitter.com/j3NaKqbsp5
