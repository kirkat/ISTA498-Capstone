Katie Walsh,4/24/2019,"Perhaps the Russos have made the final installment of the series this lackluster to make it easier to say goodbye to the superheroes, in this iteration. We really don't need another one. Not like this.",NEG
Geoffrey Macnab,4/24/2019,"This is a movie that dazzles you with its spectacle, provides plenty of irreverent slapstick and gags along the way and yet still ends with a huge emotional kick.",POS
Mark Feeney,4/24/2019,"The movie is ludicrously long, clocking in at three hours and one minute, but surprisingly satisfying.",POS
Joe Morgenstern,4/24/2019,"Succeeds at its daunting task: summing up an epic struggle with bedazzling action... and with more humor, zest and feeling -- the real, heartfelt stuff -- than you'd dare to expect from what is, after all, an immense industrial undertaking.",POS
Brandon Katz,4/24/2019,Endgame is a movie that is nothing you'd expect but everything you want.,POS
A.A. Dowd,4/24/2019,"An earnest, overstuffed, fitfully funny superhero melodrama, Endgame hits the buttons it wants to hit, and sometimes affectingly.",POS
Adam Graham,4/24/2019,"""Endgame"" contemplates big-picture themes within a superhero framework and delivers a hugely entertaining ride worthy of its monumental buildup.",POS
Michael O'Sullivan,4/24/2019,"In a sense, ""Endgame"" is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation.",POS
Kerry Lengel,4/24/2019,"The franchise has its ups and downs; the first ""Avengers"" film is certainly a highlight. But the sequels have the wisecracking-superteam formula on lockdown. They always deliver everything fans could hope for - except maybe any genuine surprise.",POS
Joshua Rothkopf,4/24/2019,"Endgame often pays tribute to itself, which makes it as fascinating as it is self-serious. It taps into a live wire of doomy tragedy and phoenix-like rebirth that comics do so well.",POS
Brian Tallerico,4/24/2019,"In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.",POS
Hannah Woodhead,4/24/2019,A potent reminder of all that's good and bad about movies.,POS
Rafer Guzman,4/24/2019,"What ""The Deathly Hallows"" was to ""Harry Potter,"" what ""Return of the Jedi"" was to the original ""Star Wars,"" this gargantuan ""Endgame"" will be to the ""Avengers.""",POS
Danny Leigh,4/24/2019,"The japey inter-hero rivalries and beyond-state-of-the-art visuals go down as easily as always in a formula which, if never quite revolutionising the comic book saga, gave it a much-needed overhaul...",POS
Peter Howell,4/24/2019,Mathematicians say infinity has no end. Avengers: Endgame thrillingly and movingly proves them wrong.,POS
Moira MacDonald,4/24/2019,"Oh yes indeed. ""Avengers: Endgame"" brought it.",POS
David Edelstein,4/24/2019,"Even at three-plus hours, the gargantuan Avengers: Endgame is light on its feet and more freely inventive than it needed to be.",POS
Cary Darling,4/24/2019,"""Endgame"" is the most emotional of the Avengers movies, a tear-stained farewell that effectively tugs at the heartstrings while simultaneously blowing them up with a large army's worth of CGI warfare.",POS
Mick LaSalle,4/24/2019,"It's a quality action movie that accomplishes, with seeming ease, a number of difficult things.",POS
Mara Reinstein,4/23/2019,Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have somehow crafted a coherent and exhilarating epic that incorporates all your favorite superheroes (and many of their loved ones) in one emotionally resonant package.,POS
