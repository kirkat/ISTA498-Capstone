Robbie Collin,4/23/2019,I can't recall a film in this cinematic universe or any other that works as relentlessly and ingeniously to keep delighting its audience than this.,POS
Mark Daniell,4/23/2019,We haven't seen anything like this before in franchise movie-making. One can only hope that the next 10 years of Marvel storytelling comes close to this.,POS
Eric Kohn,4/23/2019,"As ""Endgame"" sputters to the finish line, it leaves the impression of witnessing a Marvel Movie Marathon compressed to three hours - and 58 seconds, but trust me, they're disposable - of unbridled fan service.",POS
Jake Coyle,4/23/2019,"More than any of those franchises, ""Endgame,"" at its best moments, carries the thrill of classic comic-book twists and reversals.",POS
Barry Hertz,4/23/2019,[T]he entire endeavour loses any sense of emotional stakes or general meaning beyond the deliverance of crass fan-service and incomprehensible visuals.,NEG
Brian Truitt,4/23/2019,"If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band's individual albums, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside.",POS
Johnny Oleksinski,4/23/2019,You have to hand it to the directors for their ambition in bringing together a clown car full of characters into such a well-told and compelling yarn.,POS
Michael Phillips,4/23/2019,[E]xtravagant - and mostly very gratifying.,POS
David Sims,4/23/2019,"The Avengers, as a concept, probably won't be going anywhere, but Endgame still feels like a proper goodbye.",POS
Brian Lowry,4/23/2019,"Having set up a formidable task and then some with the finish of ""Infinity War,"" ""Avengers: Endgame"" rises to the challenge, delivering an epic finale that proves immensely satisfying.",POS
A.O. Scott,4/23/2019,"At its best - and ""Endgame"" is in some ways as good as it gets - the ""Avengers"" cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place.",POS
Leah Greenblatt,4/23/2019,"The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges.",POS
Todd McCarthy,4/23/2019,"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man.",POS
Peter Bradshaw,4/23/2019,"I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.",POS
Peter Debruge,4/23/2019,"After the must-see showdown that was 'Infinity War,' the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour followup, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.",POS
Alonso Duralde,4/23/2019,"Has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the MCU, it has the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream direct from the spray can.",POS
Justin Chang,4/23/2019,"To these faintly moistened eyes, ""Avengers: Endgame"" achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis.",POS
