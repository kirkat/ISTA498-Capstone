#Endgame isn't perfect, yet it hit home emotionally. I'm not as eloquent as @msdanifernandez but her thoughtful words really resonated w/ me as someone who also deals w/ depression. That the film showcased what that means in such a heartfelt way is a testament to it's power.https://twitter.com/msdanifernandez/status/1123781893093306369 â€¦
