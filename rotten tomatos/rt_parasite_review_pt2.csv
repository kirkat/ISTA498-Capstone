Joe Morgenstern,10/11/2019,"Imagine a high-wire act where the acrobat suddenly leaps to a higher wire, then to another that's higher still. It's the best way I can think of to describe the giddy thrill of watching Parasite, a masterpiece of serial surprises.",POS

Manohla Dargis,10/10/2019,"Bong has some ideas in ""Parasite,"" but the movie's greatness isn't a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos... but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant.",POS
Stephanie Zacharek,10/10/2019,"It tells a story you could probably follow without subtitles, or any dialogue at all: the faces of these actors show with piercing clarity how it feels to be outsiders in a world of wealth and privilege.",POS
Katie Walsh,10/9/2019,"""Parasite"" is Bong's most sophisticated film to date, expertly plotted with breathtaking reveals, and shot with a smooth, slippery sheen, each frame and camera movement communicating a subconscious plot twist or theme.",POS
