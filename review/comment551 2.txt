11 years ago today, I celebrated my 18th birthday & @RobertDowneyJr officially became Iron Man. That birthday kicked off adulthood & the #MCU. That day set up the best birthday presents of all time: new Marvel movies on/around my birthday. This year was #Endgame & it was perfect! pic.twitter.com/hst3sir6bZ
