Clarisse Loughrey,2/12/2020,"[Bong Joon-ho]'s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you.",POS
Ben Croll,2/12/2020,Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture.,POS
Rafer Guzman,2/5/2020,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.,POS
Danny Leigh,2/5/2020,"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer.",POS
Leah Greenblatt,12/11/2019,"If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too.",POS
Bob Mondello,12/11/2019,"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet.",POS
Andrew O'Hehir,12/11/2019,"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.",POS
Adam Graham,11/3/2019,"It's a fitting movie for our times, and Joon-ho delivers with uncompromising clarity and vision. See it before the inevitable American remake sands down all its razor sharp edges.",POS
James Berardinelli,11/3/2019,"Just as many of the director's previous efforts have defied pigeonholing, Parasite delights in ping-ponging from one genre to another, defying expectations along the way.",POS
Bill Goodykoontz,10/24/2019,"It's a nearly perfect film, from Bong's masterful use of framing and visual language and control of a wildly shifting tone to the performances (all terrific) to the commentary on class division.",POS
Cary Darling,10/23/2019,"""Parasite"" may be the work that makes (Bong Joon-ho) more of a household name. Many of the best elements from his previous films are on display here, and if there's one film that should serve as an introduction to his style, it's this one.",POS
Christy Lemire,10/21/2019,This is the best movie of the year... A tonal marvel.,POS
Moira MacDonald,10/21/2019,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker...,POS

Ben Sachs,10/19/2019,"Throughout, the director's camerawork and mise en scene are impressively subtle, carefully parsing out information about characters and setting to force viewers to stay alert to the tiniest details.",POS
Richard Roeper,10/19/2019,"One of the best movies of 2019, Bong Joon Ho's latest is a film of dramatic power, innovative comedy, romantic poetry and melancholy beauty.",POS
Ty Burr,10/18/2019,"""Parasite"" isn't really a monster movie. Yet on at least one of its nearly infinite levels it is - and the monsters are us.",POS
Oliver Jones,10/17/2019,"Bong... harnesses the precise anxieties everyone of us is currently sharing-top of that list, the growing income gap and the crumbling planet-and uses them to make every scene in this blackhearted comic thriller crackle with energy and purpose.",POS
Mick LaSalle,10/16/2019,Bong Joon-ho's latest masterpiece and the best film I've seen so far this year...,POS
Hau Chu,10/15/2019,"Much like the Kims, a viewer can get lulled into luxuriating in the superficial details of the film. But it's what's lurking below the surface that will stay with you long after the movie is over.",POS
Rachel Syme,10/11/2019,What starts out as a fantasy becomes a family's struggle with their place in a global framework designed to keep them down. They realize that getting out of the basement will require more than a few agile maneuvers.,POS
David Edelstein,10/11/2019,What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit - every shot distills the movie's themes - and the richness of the characters and performances...,POS
Anthony Lane,10/11/2019,"Bong, in short, is a merchant of stealth.",POS
Joe Morgenstern,10/11/2019,"Imagine a high-wire act where the acrobat suddenly leaps to a higher wire, then to another that's higher still. It's the best way I can think of to describe the giddy thrill of watching Parasite, a masterpiece of serial surprises.",POS
Mark Kennedy,10/10/2019,Bong's trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward,POS
Dana Stevens,10/10/2019,Maybe the best film Bong has yet made...,POS
Dave Calhoun,10/10/2019,"This is a dazzling work, gripping from beginning to end, full of big bangs and small wonders.",POS
David Sims,10/10/2019,"All the viewer knows is that Bong is telling a story about humans, which means it can be a perfect comedy until it becomes a tragedy.",POS
Manohla Dargis,10/10/2019,"Bong has some ideas in ""Parasite,"" but the movie's greatness isn't a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos... but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant.",POS
Stephanie Zacharek,10/10/2019,"It tells a story you could probably follow without subtitles, or any dialogue at all: the faces of these actors show with piercing clarity how it feels to be outsiders in a world of wealth and privilege.",POS
Katie Walsh,10/9/2019,"""Parasite"" is Bong's most sophisticated film to date, expertly plotted with breathtaking reveals, and shot with a smooth, slippery sheen, each frame and camera movement communicating a subconscious plot twist or theme.",POS
Peter Travers,10/9/2019,Let's just say it: the South Korean auteur Bong Joon Ho is some kind of genius and he tops himself with 'Parasite'-it's explosive filmmaking on every level and one of the cinema high points of 2019 . You won't know what hit you.,POS
Brian Truitt,10/8/2019,"""Parasite"" attaches to you and doesn't let go.",POS
Katie Rife,10/7/2019,"If anything, Parasite is a condemnation of choosing to ignore the inconvenient suffering of your fellow human beings, presented in a seres of accomplished visual metaphors that'll make you rethink all sorts of ordinary household objects.",POS
Peter Howell,9/11/2019,Satire morphs into a savage underclass morality lesson that recalls the home invasion tales of Michael Haneke and Jordan Peele.,POS
Brian Tallerico,9/7/2019,Parasite is unquestionably one of the best films of the year.,POS
Barry Hertz,9/7/2019,"An exhilarating and furious indictment of class struggle, Parasite might be the masterpiece South Korea's Bong Joon-ho has been working toward his entire career.",POS
Jake Wilson,6/26/2019,"The inspired Parasite can't precisely be labelled a comedy, a thriller, nor a socially conscious drama about the class divide in South Korea, although it contains elements of all three.",POS
Ed Potton,5/26/2019,"You expect the whole enterprise to come crashing down around his ears, but this is a film-maker in total control of his craft.",POS
Emma Jones,5/26/2019,The social commentary is almost as powerful as the plot itself.,POS
A.A. Dowd,5/24/2019,"Shifts tonal gears in total service of its class politics, infecting the film's breezy dark-comedy with notes of rage and melancholy.",POS
Justin Chang,5/23/2019,"""Parasite"" begins in exhilaration and ends in devastation, but the triumph of the movie is that it fully lives and breathes at every moment, even when you might find yourself struggling to exhale.",POS
David Ehrlich,5/22/2019,"The impotent rage he feels about that spills into every frame of this incredible film, and leaves us all a little richer as a result.",POS
Bilge Ebiri,5/22/2019,A nerve-racking masterpiece whose spell lingers long after its haunting final image.,POS
Hannah Woodhead,5/22/2019,"Pivoting from hysteria to grotesque on a moment's notice, it's a bloodthirsty farce.",POS
Jessica Kiang,5/21/2019,"Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: ""Parasite"" is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage.",POS

Peter Bradshaw,5/21/2019,Parasite gets its tendrils into you.,POS

Betty Jo Tucker,4/13/2020,"'Parasite' includes some wish-I-never-saw-that scenes. Viewers who are faint of heart should be forewarned, but horror fans might enjoy the carnage.",NEG
Tony Macklin,2/11/2020,The parasites have parasites.,NEG
Paddy Kehoe,1/13/2020,"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change.",NEG
Rick Kisonak,11/6/2019,"That's not ""savage commentary."" That's condescension. This is by far the filmmaker's most commercially successful work to date...",NEG
Prairie Miller,10/24/2019,"A condescending, pessimistic portrayal of human nature, bereft of class consciousness or ideology...",NEG
Armond White,10/11/2019,"Bong is an unfunny extremist. In Parasite, he annihilates the concept of the nuclear family by setting a brood of lower-class con artists against an upper-class family unit.",NEG
