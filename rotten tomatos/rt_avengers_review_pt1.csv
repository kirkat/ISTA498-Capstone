Amy Nicholson,9/27/2019,This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.,POS
Oliver Jones,5/1/2019,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.",POS
Matthew Norman,4/28/2019,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.,POS
Richard Brody,4/28/2019,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder.",NEG
Matthew Lickona,4/27/2019,"The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment.",POS
Dana Stevens,4/26/2019,Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone's favorite parts of these movies anyway.,POS
Kevin Maher,4/26/2019,"It's overdone and bombastic. A fitting end, in other words, to a franchise cycle of insatiable commercial ambition...and thundering creative swagger.",POS
Matthew Rozsa,4/26/2019,"There are horror movies and political dramas with premises less nightmarish than the one in ""Avengers: Endgame... This is an interesting approach for a superhero film to take.",POS
Anthony Lane,4/26/2019,"You can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.",NEG
Bob Mondello,4/26/2019,"No matter how much homework you've done, what actually happens, the order in which it happens and the folks to whom it happens will still pack surprises - also tongue-in-cheekiness and quite a bit of lump-in-throatiness.",POS
Leah Pickett,4/25/2019,"A film that should feel overlong and overstuffed rings purposeful, weighted with existential truth even as it flashes before our eyes.",POS
Peter Rainer,4/25/2019,"Despite all the whiz-bang CGI effects, some more special than others, the moments I most appreciated in Endgame were the small-scale comic touches... Best of all is Robert Downey Jr.",POS
Chris Hewitt,4/25/2019,"It's an episodic movie, so it shines in parts, rather than as a whole, but there are plenty of good parts.",POS
Peter Travers,4/25/2019,The MCU's long goodbye to the Avengers (is it really?) comes off as truly epic and thunderously exciting. But here's the big surprise-it's also an emotional wipeout .,POS
James Berardinelli,4/25/2019,"Avengers: Endgame isn't as brash, surprising, or relentless as its predecessor but it's a worthy conclusion to the Infinity War duology and provides a satisfying end to the First Avengers Era.",POS
Jake Wilson,4/25/2019,"For young adults who have literally grown up with these movies, the experience may be emotionally overwhelming.",POS
Richard Roeper,4/24/2019,The Motion Picture Academy never recognizes great acting if it comes attached to a costume or a cape. That doesn't mean Downey isn't deserving of an Oscar. It's great acting in a great film.,POS
Nicholas Barber,4/24/2019,[I]t is slick and affectionate enough for its three-hour running time to pass quickly.,POS
John Wenzel,4/24/2019,"The MCU sticks this landing, allowing us to let go of years of baggage and get ready for the next flight.",POS
Stephanie Zacharek,4/24/2019,"It's an entertainment designed to please many, many people and disappoint as few as possible, extravagant without necessarily having a vision beyond its desire not to put a foot wrong.",POS
