Clarisse Loughrey,2/12/2020,"[Bong Joon-ho]'s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you.",POS
Ben Croll,2/12/2020,Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture.,POS
Rafer Guzman,2/5/2020,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.,POS
Danny Leigh,2/5/2020,"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer.",POS
Leah Greenblatt,12/11/2019,"If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too.",POS
Bob Mondello,12/11/2019,"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet.",POS
Andrew O'Hehir,12/11/2019,"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.",POS
Adam Graham,11/3/2019,"It's a fitting movie for our times, and Joon-ho delivers with uncompromising clarity and vision. See it before the inevitable American remake sands down all its razor sharp edges.",POS
James Berardinelli,11/3/2019,"Just as many of the director's previous efforts have defied pigeonholing, Parasite delights in ping-ponging from one genre to another, defying expectations along the way.",POS
Bill Goodykoontz,10/24/2019,"It's a nearly perfect film, from Bong's masterful use of framing and visual language and control of a wildly shifting tone to the performances (all terrific) to the commentary on class division.",POS
Cary Darling,10/23/2019,"""Parasite"" may be the work that makes (Bong Joon-ho) more of a household name. Many of the best elements from his previous films are on display here, and if there's one film that should serve as an introduction to his style, it's this one.",POS
Christy Lemire,10/21/2019,This is the best movie of the year... A tonal marvel.,POS
Moira MacDonald,10/21/2019,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker...,POS
Michael Phillips,10/19/2019,"""Parasite"" expresses consequential ideas that matter to the filmmaker about the way we live today, and the prejudice and malice we create for ourselves and others.",POS
Ben Sachs,10/19/2019,"Throughout, the director's camerawork and mise en scene are impressively subtle, carefully parsing out information about characters and setting to force viewers to stay alert to the tiniest details.",POS
Richard Roeper,10/19/2019,"One of the best movies of 2019, Bong Joon Ho's latest is a film of dramatic power, innovative comedy, romantic poetry and melancholy beauty.",POS
Ty Burr,10/18/2019,"""Parasite"" isn't really a monster movie. Yet on at least one of its nearly infinite levels it is - and the monsters are us.",POS
Oliver Jones,10/17/2019,"Bong... harnesses the precise anxieties everyone of us is currently sharing-top of that list, the growing income gap and the crumbling planet-and uses them to make every scene in this blackhearted comic thriller crackle with energy and purpose.",POS
Mick LaSalle,10/16/2019,Bong Joon-ho's latest masterpiece and the best film I've seen so far this year...,POS
Hau Chu,10/15/2019,"Much like the Kims, a viewer can get lulled into luxuriating in the superficial details of the film. But it's what's lurking below the surface that will stay with you long after the movie is over.",POS
