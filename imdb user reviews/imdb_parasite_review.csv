mysticfall,POS,18 October 2019," For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half
","It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
Jeremy_Urquhart,POS,5 July 2019," One of the best films of this decade
","I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
jtindahouse,POS,6 October 2019," You name a genre, this movie covers it
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
nehpetstephen,POS,25 August 2019," Meritocracy: it's metaphorical
","In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
Aaron_Kyle,POS,28 December 2019," A modern era masterpiece
","Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.Parasite can best be described as astonishing, astounding, stunning or any other synonym of amazing. It is so far my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite films of the decade. The very idea of the plot is simple but incredibly hard to execute and that's, why it's editing, is pitch-perfect and leads to an unexpectedly shocking and brutal ending.The biggest forte of Parasite is the screenplay as it impeccably mixes comedy, drama and horror featuring flawless pacing, breath-taking cinematography, a beautiful score and a brilliant cast making it a masterpiece. Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them. Themes of capitalism can also be felt throughout the film, but Parasite shouldn't be mistaken as a pro-capitalism film as it doesn't support or hate anyone or any side; it's ambiguity also contributes to this factor.Taking everything into account, Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by everyone at some point in their lives, especially film lovers.Final Rating - 10/10"

","I came to this movie with an open mind, despite the hoo ha around it. Stylistically yep, I can see the hoo haa. The same goes for the acting, once again exceptional . The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'. It's good that western audiences will watch it and hopefully realise there is a film industry outside of the west..but this film just an ok for me"
tmcapitals,POS,5 November 2019," One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen
","Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
alitaha-88852,POS,4 January 2020," Too hyped, not too bad.
","Here's how i rate a movie the fast way, i ask myself two questions.
Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ?
Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future."

There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
DJKwa,POS,2 July 2019," Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us
","As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
southbankcinema,NEG,26 May 2019," Society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people
","Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
matthew-41243,POS,7 January 2020," Ok film, but that's all. Overrated for sure.
","The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
jmholmes-73727,POS,4 November 2019," FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD
","This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
federovsky,NEG,10 February 2020," Objectionable
","How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years."
dougal79,POS,17 August 2019," Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!
","What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"

CineMuseFilms,POS,28 December 2019," A black comedy on social inequality
","There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."

","Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
CineMuseFilms,POS,28 December 2019," A black comedy on social inequality
","There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."
crownofsprats,POS,22 August 2019," Observations
","Firstly, movie hype of the wildfire sort (ovation, talk of Cannes, etc) grossly overinflates expectations for a film. If you've read 50 reviews calling something 'best film ever' and then watch said film, I can almost guarantee you will not share their opinion afterwards. No, it's not a flawless masterpiece that will be remembered for centuries - but just because others think so is no reason to hate on it either, since it is undoubtedly an accomplished and entertaining piece of filmmaking.Haters may hate for ideological reasons: something is definitely fishy with the skewed helpful/unhelpful ratio on most of these reviews (it's 1:5 to 1:10 for most reviews), which may or may not point to some sort campaign of orchestrated manipulation, or at the very least an outpouring of emotion. Clearly this has people roiled up!Which is funny, because it's not really all that clear what there is to get roiled up about! Lots of reviewers talk about the underlying themes and motifs and whatnot, vaguely alluding to what those are - class struggle, a dash of political allegory - but no one so far has written up any sort of concrete analysis that decodes the film, pointing out the literary, cinematic, political, or psychological allusions in specific scenes. If you read enough of these reviews, you know there's always at least one arch-geek who takes on the challenge and posts something that borders on coherent and insightful. The North Korea references would be a great place to start, perhaps.But yeah, I suspect this aggravated the sensibilities of some anti-anti-capitalist types, who rail against any lefty do-gooder subtext and want their films all storytelling and no agenda. (This is a silly expectation, since most storytelling throughout history is overtly agenda-driven.) Though it's definitely not a 'pro-capitalism' film, it is quite ambiguous about its morality, and there is no one to really root for or hate. This is actually one of its more subtle but grandiose achievements.More to the point are criticisms of the acting, which may or may not be annoying (I don't speak Korean, so I cannot fully judge). Plot is on the improbable side, although the 'fun factor' of watching this unravel counterweighs the contrived nature of the initial setup. The final stretch doesn't quite deliver (if it did, this would be a 9-10), and there's an unnecessary and rather maudlin coda.But overall, strong work, and definitely one of the year's must-see films."
collisd,POS,1 February 2020," Parasite: a poignant reflection upon inequality - and funny
","This film - Parasite - is so good that I set up an IMDB account to write about it. The film is a reflection upon poverty and wealth, an issue that is visible and salient in South Korea where the film is set. It uses humour, likeable characters, and a mischievous pace to draw in the viewer. Like a frog in the proverbial slowly-heating pot, we unwittingly come to consider what it means to be poor, what it means to be rich, and the volatile interface between the two.I began watching the film barracking for the various characters of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they weave themselves into the life of the wealthy Park family. The Kim family son, Ki-woo, pretends to be an English tutor to the Park family's daughter. In turn, Ki-woo draws in his sister, Ki-jung, who pretends to be an art therapist, to work with the traumatised Park family son. The mischief expands like a spider web, as the Kim family father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, take further positions within the Park family as their driver and housekeeper. It's a simple premise taken to a ludicrous extreme, making the film both real and not-real.Beneath the light-hearted tone in which the 'parasitic' enmeshment is established, a dark underbelly of resentment reveals itself as the poorer Kim family inhabits the life of the wealthy Park family. As their unlikely success grows, the Kim family shift from a mindset of sporadic life resignations towards the dangerous realm of possibility. The Kim family may actually find a way out of poverty by inhabiting of the Park family house. The second half of the film shifts gear to explore the violence and ruthless deception that is spawned within this up-close-and-personal straddling of absurd extremes of inequality.Parasite calls on its viewers to understand the dynamics of inequality through this fable-istic account of two families, both having their own type of parasitic relation to each other. The Kim family is parasitic on the money of the Park family; the Park family, in turn, is parasitic on the Kim family to do life's chores. With great agility, the film sidesteps the temptation to valorise the poor or demonise the rich. We like all the characters, but there are no heroes. Instead, Parasite invites us to reflect upon inequality in its inglorious everyday forms. The Park family father doesn't like the smell of the Kim family father, while the Park family son inadvertently almost reveals the Kim family ruse by innocently noting that 'they all smell the same.' Poverty and wealth are not abstract categories; they are smells, experienced differently by rich and poor.In this down-to-earth-ness, the filmmaker, Bong Joon-ho, explicitly calls on viewers to interpret the movie on different levels. From the opening scenes, the Kim family son, Ki-woon, repeats the word 'metaphorical.' He is ostensibly talking about a rock that is supposed to bring wealth, but we viewers are left to open up wider horizons of meanings, such as: societies of great inequality must inevitably devolve into transactional-parasitic relations; wealthy families in the midst of poverty must inevitably defend against the social incursions of poorer people doing what they can to survive, as well as defending against the psychological incursions of bad conscience. In every rich household there is something hidden in the basement, as least psychologically.This film holds its line against the temptation to explicitly condemn the evils of inequality. Instead it relentlessly represents the dynamics of inequality, drawing away from the judgement of individual characters, leaving it to viewers to make sense of it. Being vague enough to not spoil the ending, the film's climax portrays violence bubbling up as an expression of long-suppressed resentment. It does so in light of a jarring juxtaposition between the despairing circumstances of the poorer family hitting rock bottom, and the oblivious self-centredness of the rich family who are circumstantially geared by the everyday realities of inequality to not want to know about anything outside their bubble.If the film has a political point, it shifts the debate about inequality. Instead of talking about the 'deserving poor' or the 'greedy rich', the film describes the impoverished social ecosystem of unequal societies, and the social roles and habits these societies require of their people. Violence in the face of absurd levels of inequality does not come from character flaws. But, rather, it emerges as the breaking point of the logics and habits of inequality taken to their logical extreme.An untended pot of boiling water creates scalding steam, and eventually bubbles over."
joesiegel,POS,30 January 2020," It's so metaphorical
","""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."

michaeltrivedi,POS,16 January 2020," Great
","I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance.

","We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.
Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.
In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.
This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.
Their crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be.

jimbikerider,POS,15 January 2020," Parasite and Schizophrenia
","An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.
There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.
Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.
Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,
Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.
Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.
In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?
A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy
Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.
Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.
The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.
The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.
The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.
However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.
Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.
The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."

eoghanorourke-00011,POS,9 February 2020," Who the Parasite really was:
","We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.
Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.
In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.
This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.
Their crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner.
The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host."

","Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
jimbikerider,POS,15 January 2020," Parasite and Schizophrenia
","An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.
There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.
Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.
Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,
Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.
Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.
In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?
A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy
Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.
Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.
The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.
The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.
The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.
However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.
Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.
The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."

","This is true masterpiece
It's unpredictable i love this movie"
chasemykleby,POS,6 November 2019," Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.
","""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."

","It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did."
mikbanerjee1,POS,11 February 2020," The Social Commentary, It Showcases is Spectacular!
","If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally.
Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation."

koushikdas508,POS,10 February 2020," PARASITE: Dark, Socially themed, Multi-dimensional, Highly thought-provoking and an incandescent cinematic roller coaster!
","Korean films are love. Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective.
Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure.
Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience.
No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.
It's rightfully the MOVIE OF THE YEAR OF 2019!"

","When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain."

patcostello2006,POS,22 January 2020," Pleasantly disturbing
","Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious.
It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop...
Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.
The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable-
When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.

stringheralong,POS,20 January 2020," A social commentary of the highest order
","As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example ""Crossing the line"" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it."

","Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.
The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."

","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."
