#ENDGAME SPOILER ALERT . . . . . . . . . . Maybe that shield was Sam's after all. Remember Cap's shield was destroyed during the final battle. Marvel recently announced that there would be a Falcon and Winter Soldier series on Disney+. Falcon is the new Cap in the comics. Idk. pic.twitter.com/UDZHVUlHRy
